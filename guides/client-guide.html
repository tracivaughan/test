                        Just as we are making adjustments, our clients are affected by changes to our process. Below
                        is a summary of how to explain our process to clients, and to prepare them to participate.
                        You can also download a reference PDF that you can share with clients:

                    <section class="pko-steps">
                        <h2 class="hexh2 hex1"><img src="../img/guide1.png" alt="#1">Our process is more team- and
                            design-centered than in the past</h2>

                        <p> That means that clients might be <strong>interacting with more team members, more often, and
                                providing more feedback</strong>. We will need their participation, and their feedback
                            early in the
                            design process -- including looking at rough sketches and iterations of ideas. Not only does
                            this yield a better product, but it also takes some of the pressure off clients to define
                            100% of what they want/need at the outset of the process.</p>

                        <p>While we focus on design, it's important that clients understand "design" is problem-solving,
                            not just "making things pretty." It may take several rounds before we get to a pixel-perfect
                            version.

                            user-centered</h2>
                        <p>The new SDLC prioritizes creating products that resonate with and help end users, as well as
                            clients. This means that we engage actual users in the design process, to hear first-hand
                            their priorities and reactions. While clients will be happy with the result (better
                            products!), they need to understand that <strong>we will need access to end users</strong>,
                            and we want
                            those users to speak for themselves.</p>

                            collaboration</h2>

                        <p>Learning what clients want, need, and prefer is vital. But it's also helpful for clients to
                            be <strong>open to new ideas, learning from users, and to be active in sharing
                                feedback and setting priorities</strong>. In addition, it's important for clients to
                            understand that
                            iteration is not reworking or redoing <em lang="la">ad infinitum</em>; feedback has to be
                            prompt, and decisions shouldn't be constantly revisited. </p>
